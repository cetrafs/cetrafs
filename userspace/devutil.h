 * cetrafs_device_mounted(): is this block device currently mounted
 * anywhere on this system? Both tools refuse to touch a mounted device
 * outright -- fsck reading structures the kernel is concurrently
 * mutating produces garbage "errors" at best, and mkfs writing under a
 * live mount destroys it; neither has a legitimate use, so there is no
 * override flag (mkfs's -f is about overwriting on-disk *data*, not
 * about racing a live kernel).
 *
 * Matching is by device number (st_rdev), not path string: the same
 * device is commonly reachable via several names (/dev/sda,
 * /dev/disk/by-id/..., a symlink), and /proc/self/mounts records
 * whichever one was used at mount time. That is a same-SYSTEM check
 * only, which on this project's real deployment (a shared iSCSI/FC LUN)
 * misses the case that matters most: another NODE having the volume
 * mounted right now. cetrafs_find_live_peer() below covers that by
 * reading what the peers themselves wrote -- the Node Registry.

/*
 * Is some OTHER machine currently mounting this volume?
 *
 * Decided by WATCHING a candidate row's hb_seq advance, never by
 * comparing its last_seen against this machine's clock.
 *
 * The clock comparison is what this used to do, and its own comment
 * waved the problem away as "a reason to treat a positive answer as
 * authoritative and a negative one as merely probable". That was far too
 * generous: a negative answer here is what lets mkfs reformat the
 * device, so under clock skew -- two real nodes were found 1h55m apart,
 * neither running a working NTP service -- this would have cheerfully
 * destroyed a volume another host was actively running VMs off. Exactly
 * the catastrophe the check exists to prevent.
 *
 * A mounted node bumps hb_seq every CETRAFS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS, so
 * sampling twice far enough apart answers the question with no clock
 * agreement required at all. The cost is the wait, which is paid ONLY
 * when some row actually looks like it might be live: a never-mounted
 * device, or one every node left cleanly (last_seen == 0), returns
 * immediately.
 *
 * Returns 1 and fills the out-parameters for the first live peer found,
 * 0 if none (including when the device is not a cetrafs volume at all --
 * nothing can be mounting it as one), and -1 when the registry CANNOT BE
 * READ (an I/O error on a volume that claims to be cetrafs): "unreadable"
 * is not "nobody", and both callers run DESTRUCTIVE operations on the
 * strength of this answer -- they must fail closed on -1. A read that
 * merely falls off the end of the device stays 0, same as the
 * bounded-garbage case below: that is a corrupt layout, not a peer.
 *
 * Rows that fail their checksum are skipped rather than trusted: a torn
 * or garbage row must not be able to block a format forever. FREE rows
 * are skipped too -- mkfs leaves the table zero-filled and never stamps
 * a checksum on one.
 *
 * out_age_secs is filled with the wall-clock age of the row for display
 * only; it is meaningless under skew and nothing decides anything with
 * it.
